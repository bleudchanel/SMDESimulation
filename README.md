# Simulation Project for the course Statistical Modelling and Design of Experiments
## for the Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics, Specialization in Advanced Computing

The following is a simulation project of the performance of runners of the Boston Marathon of 2017. This project is based on material from the course “Statistical Modelling and Design of Experiments”, and the book “Simulation: The Practice of Model Development and Use” by Stewart Robinson. The project starts with a brief description of the system to model, including the specification of its components, and processes involved. Then we follow up with a definition of the experimental framework that uses a factorial design, and the validation of the model. We have also included the source code of the program we wrote in python to facilitate the experimentation process.

Although the research that led into this project has been thoroughly performed, it is important to note that this is a 1st Semester Course and there is ample room for improvement. For the most part, this is a introductory project into the practice of Simulation.

Best Regards,

Wilmer
